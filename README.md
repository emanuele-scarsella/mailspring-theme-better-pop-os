# Pop!_OS theme for Mailsprings

I wanted to create a [Mailspring](https://getmailspring.com/) theme which better integrates with dark theme on Pop!_OS.
So my colour choices were deeply inspired by this operating system. 
Since this is a dark theme, it is necessary to modify the style of email messages to be displayed correctly. For this reason I reused the code from a [Predawn](https://github.com/asparc/predawn) Mailspring theme. So all the credits go to asparc.
